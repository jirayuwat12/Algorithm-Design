# Closest pair

## Problem

- Given n points in the plane, find the closest pair of points.

## Input

- Given A[0..n-1] of points in the plane.
- where A[i] = (x,y) is the i-th point.

## Output

- The distance between the closest pair of points.

## Solutions

- Brute force: O(n^2)
- Divide and conquer: O(nlogn) [code](Closest_pair.py)
